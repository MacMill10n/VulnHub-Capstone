# Vulnerable By Design Capstone
This capstone project from HyperionDev uses a Virtual Machine from Vulnerable By Dessign (VulnHub).
The goal of the project was to access the machine and get the users passwords by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software installed on the machine.
This goal was accomplished by :
- Using Metasploit to access a vulnerability in the ProFTPD software on version 1.3.3.c.
- Using a reverse shell to connect to my machine
- Sending the shadow file containing all the user hashed passwords to my machine
## Improvements that could be made
The project answers could be improved by explaining:
- More indepth on where the vaulnerability lied.
- The problem by having such a vaulnerability.
- A list of possible fixes to the vaulnerability.
